# Similarity-Score-with-Fuzzy-Matching
Fuzzy matching in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a technique used to approximate text or words based on their similarity or resemblance, even if there are variations in spelling, structure, or format. This technique is valuable when attempting to match text that might have typos, spelling variations, or minor differences in words.

Fuzzy matching involves the use of specialized algorithms, such as the Levenshtein (edit distance), Jaro-Winkler, or cosine similarity algorithms, to measure how similar two texts are. The result of fuzzy matching is a score or value that represents the level of similarity between the compared texts. This technique is often used in text search, entity recognition, auto-correction, data deduplication, and other NLP tasks where perfect accuracy may not always be achievable.
