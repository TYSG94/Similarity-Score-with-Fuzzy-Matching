# Similarity-Score-with-Fuzzy-Matching
Fuzzy matching in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a technique used to approximate text or words based on their similarity or resemblance, even if there are variations in spelling, structure, or format. This technique is valuable when attempting to match text that might have typos, spelling variations, minor differences in words, or data deduplication.
